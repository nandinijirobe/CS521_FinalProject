# CS521_FinalProject

Source Code: The source code for this project can be found in the Final_CS_521_Research_Project_4_22.ipynb file that is in this repository
Documentation: The well-commented source code is available in a notebook format with each phase (data collection, cleaning, POS tagging, topic modelling, results) divided into sections. To run the file, you need to download the file, add it to Google Colab, set runtime connection to TPU or A100 GPU, and then run all cells. 
Results files: Screenshots of the results from the notebook is saved in this repository as pos_graph_results.jpg and topic_modelling_results.jpg
